# Spotify Troubleshooting - Adding Multiple Shows

## Common Issues When Adding a New Show

### Issue 1: "Add Show" Button Not Visible

**Solution:**
1. Go to [Spotify for Podcasters Dashboard](https://podcasters.spotify.com/)
2. Look for your existing show (AudioNews UK)
3. In the top right corner, look for:
   - A "+" button
   - "Add show" link
   - "Add or claim your podcast" button
4. If you don't see it, try:
   - Refreshing the page
   - Logging out and back in
   - Using a different browser

### Issue 2: First Show Not Yet Approved

**Problem:** Spotify may require your first show to be fully approved before allowing additional shows.

**Solution:**
- Wait 24-48 hours for the first show to be approved
- Check the status of your first show in the dashboard
- Once approved, you should be able to add more shows

### Issue 3: Account Verification Required

**Problem:** Your account may need additional verification.

**Solution:**
1. Check your email for verification requests
2. Ensure your email address is verified in Spotify settings
3. Complete any pending verification steps

### Issue 4: Using the Wrong Method

**Alternative Method:**
1. Go directly to: https://podcasters.spotify.com/dashboard
2. Look for "Add show" or "Add podcast" in the navigation
3. Or try: https://podcasters.spotify.com/add-show

### Issue 5: RSS Feed Already Claimed

**Problem:** If you try to add the same RSS feed twice, Spotify will reject it.

**Solution:**
- Each show needs a unique RSS feed (which you already have)
- Make sure you're using the correct RSS feed URL:
  - Polish: `https://audionews.uk/pl_PL/podcast.rss`
  - BellaNews: `https://audionews.uk/bella/podcast.rss`

## Step-by-Step: Adding a Second Show

1. **Log in to Spotify for Podcasters**
   - Go to https://podcasters.spotify.com/
   - Sign in with your Spotify account

2. **Navigate to Add Show**
   - Look for "Add show" button (usually top right or in main dashboard)
   - Or go to: https://podcasters.spotify.com/add-show

3. **Select "I have an RSS feed"**

4. **Enter the RSS feed URL**
   - For Polish: `https://audionews.uk/pl_PL/podcast.rss`
   - For BellaNews: `https://audionews.uk/bella/podcast.rss`

5. **Complete verification**
   - Check email for verification link
   - Click the verification link

6. **Submit for review**
